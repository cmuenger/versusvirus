### Agent Based Modelling Contagious Disease  
SEIR model (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) with integration of geographical information. 


### Basic Methods Modelling Contagious Diseases  
23 page overview over SIR model and stochastic branching model. Most likely a solid/decent introduction.

### Social Contagioun 
SIS model with an automatic ('spontaneous') extension in a social network setting. Might be another lead to combine SIS/SIR with stochastic models.
